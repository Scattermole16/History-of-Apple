            <span id="greenspan">Imagine a day without your computer. It‚Äôs not as easy as it sounds and that is because we use computers every</span>
          <span id="yellowspan">single day even though you may not even realize it. If computers had never been invented, we wouldn‚Äôt be able to</span>
          <span id="orangespan">communicate, calculate, or create in the incredible ways that we can today. One of the biggest contributors to the</span>
          <span id="redspan">world of computing is the company <strong id="redspan">Apple</strong>. Without <strong id="redspan">Steve Jobs</strong> and <strong id="redspan">Steve Wozniak</strong>, computing would simply not</span>
          <span id="purplespan">be where it is today. Although Apple didn‚Äôt launch until almost exactly 30 years after the first computer was </span>
          <span id="bluespan">invented by <strong id="bluespan">John Mauchly</strong> and <strong id="bluespan">J. Presper Eckert</strong>, it was incredibly innovative and new for its time.</span>
      </p>
      <p> Computing all started from the invention of the <strong>abacus</strong>. It was a device used to aid the mind
          in mathematical calculations. It is composed of a wood frame connected by dowels with beads of some type of
          material sliding across to perform the calculations. This was essentially the first calculator and ever since
          the abacus, the world has never been the same. Fast-forward a couple hundred years and you have the invention
          of the first computer called the <strong>ENIAC</strong> which was completed in 1945 but not introduced until
          early 1946, this was the Dawn of the Electronic Era.
      </p>
      <p>Apple all started when Jobs and Wozniak met at the Homebrew Computer Club. Woz had seen his first
          <strong>MITS Altair</strong> there and ‚Äúwas inspired by MITS‚Äô build-it-yourself approach
          (the Altair came as a kit) to make something simpler for the rest of us‚Äù(Rawlinson, 2016), thus causing the
          creation of the very first <strong>Apple I</strong>. When Woz created this Apple I he wasn‚Äôt doing it to show
          people that a computer should be a typewriter for the keyboard input and a tv for the monitor output, he built
          it to show off to his friends and say that he could do the most with the smallest amount. Then steve came in
          and his <img id="AppleI" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/Apple_I_Computer.jpg">
          entrepreneurial mindset kicked in and he thought
          about all the ways that they could make money with this simple computer. Jobs and Woz sold some of their most
          valuable items to get the production of these computers rolling and history was made on April 1st 1976. Apple
          started by building each computer by hand and Woz only wanted to sell them ‚Äúfor little more than the cost of
          their parts‚Äù(Rawlinson) but Jobs priced the computer at $666.66 and made ‚Äúa deal with the Byte Shop in
          Mountain View to supply it with 50 computers at $500 each‚Äù(Rawlinson). There were 2 big problems though, they
          had 4 hands to make 50 computers in just a short amount of time, and they couldn‚Äôt afford to buy all of the
          parts to make 50 Apple I‚Äôs. Jobs was very persistent to get the parts so he wound up speaking to Paul Tarell,
          the owner of Byte Shop and he ended up striking a deal to front Jobs all the parts on a 30 day credit. This
          solved the problem of not having enough money for all of the expensive parts needed to build the computers but
          now Apple needed more hands on deck so they convinced family and close friends to all sit around the table and
          solder parts together and they completed all 50 computers. This was the first success story of Apple
          computers and it started the empire that we know and love today. R.I.P Steve Jobs, you‚Äôll be missedüò¢
